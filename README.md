# FeatherDoc

A support platform meant for devs to ask questions and collaborate to solve problems. You can take personal notes in the local-first notebook with links to threads, embedded scratchpads and playgrounds, and images. Threads are helpful encapsulated places for users to ask questions and receive help through the chat. You'll be able to share a drawing scratchpad with the other commentors and a helpful playground to test run code in, all while being able to see live edits.
